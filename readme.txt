Plugin for displaying random quotes from the American Civil War in the description under the title

== Description ==

This Plugin displays random quotes from various participants during the American Civil War (1861 - 1865). If you have a history website, The American Civil War only website, or 
you just want to display quotes from that period, then this plugin is for you.
All quotes shall appear beneath the title. For example, if the title of your website is
"General Robert E. Lee" and the current description is "The life of General Lee"
then after the installation of the plugin, the line will be changed to a random
quote with each refresh of the page. You can refresh the webpage with F5.
All quotes are stored in the acwlore_quotes.txt file in the directory of the ACW Lore plugin.

== Installation ==

How to install this plugin?

1. Upload `acw_lore` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Refresh your homepage

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I installed the plugin and a quote still does not appear! =

The WP core function "bloginfo('description')" must be set below wp_title() in the header.php file of your theme.

= Can I add more quotes? =

Yes you can, but you must be careful not to mess things up. 

= I promise I won't mess things up, how do I add more quotes? =

Go to wp-content/plugins/acw_lore/acw_lore_quotes.txt
In the file you will see a bunch of lines. Those are the quotes.
Write your quote, but be careful, each quote must end with a line break "\n"
For example, if you want to add the quote "Why do men fight who were born to be brothers? - James Longstreet"
by Longstret, you add it at the end of the file, below the last quote and in one 
straight line. If the line breaks (\n) automatically, that's fine. If you break
it intentionally, the quote will be halved in two. Like if you write
"Why do men fight who
 were born to be brothers?" - James Longstreet
 Two quotes will come out of that. "Why do men fight who" and "were born to be brothers? - James Longstreet" and that would not be cool. 

= I messed things up, how can I fix everything? =

Pre-install and plugin and stop pretending to be a programmer.

= This is an awesome plugin, how can I thank Stefany? =

I will be very grateful if you put my website www.dyulgerova.info 
in your page.
